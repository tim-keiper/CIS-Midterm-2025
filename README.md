# CIS Midterm

## Part 1: Functions

This program provides two functions:

1. **Calculate the area of a rectangle**:
   - The program prompts the user to input the **length** and **width** of a rectangle.
   - It then calculates the area using: **Area = Length × Width** and displays the result.

2. **Check if a number is prime**:
   - The program takes an integer input from the user.
   - It checks if the number is a prime number (a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself).
   - It will inform the user whether the input number is prime or not and returns **True** if prime and **False** if not.


## Part 2: Loops and Arrays

This part of the program provides two functionalities:

1. **Print all even numbers from 1 to 50**:
   - The program uses a **for loop** to iterate through numbers between 1 to 50, by starting at 2 and incrementing by 2 each time.
   - It prints each even number in the sequence on the screen.

2. **Populate an integer array and print its values**:
   - The program declares an integer array of size 10.
   - It uses a **while loop** to prompt the user to input 10 integers, which are stored in the array.
   - Once the array is populated, a **for loop** is used to print the values stored in the array to the console.

## Part 3: CIN and Variables

This part of the program uses **cin** to accept user input as well as variable declaration andinitialization.

1. **Accepting user input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input their **name**, **age**, and **favorite number**.
   - It uses **cin** to capture the user’s input and stores it in appropriate variables.
   - The program then prints the user’s name, age, and favorite number in a formatted output using **cout**.

2. **Declaring and initializing variables**:
   - The program declares and initializes variables of different data types: **int**, **float**, **double**, **char**, **string**, **bool**, **long**, **short**, and **unsigned int**.
   - It then prints the values of these variables to the screen.

## Part 4: Logical Operators and IF Statements

This part of the program provides two functionalities:

1. **Determine the largest of three numbers**:
   - The program asks the user to input **three numbers** and determines the largest using **nested if statements**.

2. **Check if a given year is a leap year**:
   - The program asks the user to input a **year**.
   - It checks if the year is a **leap year** using **logical operators** like `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR).
   - The program will print whether the input year is a leap year or not.

## Part 5: Switch Case

This program is simple calculator using a **switch case**. It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the user's input.

Functionality:
- The user enters two numbers and a mathematical operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- The program performs the corresponding operation:
  - **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division** (with a check for division by zero).
- If an invalid operator is entered, an error message is displayed.
